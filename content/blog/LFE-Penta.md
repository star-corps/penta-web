Announcing the biggest blockchain project in football. The London Football Exchange is joining forces with Penta, a next generation public blockchain, to build the first decentralized application for a fan-driven football community.  <!--more--> LFE and Penta will offer fans worldwide the chance to experience football in a new and exciting way: receive access to exclusive event tickets, private tours of football clubs and stadiums, opportunities to meet with your favourite football stars and coaches, special merchandise offers, and more.

In the words of Jim Alyward, co-founder of the London Footbal Exchange:

‘At the LFE we are developing a platform where football meets the blockchain so we can create benefits for every participant in the football community.

‘Penta is the type of progressive collaborator who will not only help us improve the current experiences of the football community but also work in partnership with them to imagine new possibilities.’

This partnership includes a technical collaboration on three different levels:

1) Penta will supply blockchain technology to LFE and assist with technical development and smart contracts.

2) The LFE platform will use the Penta blockchain to support its decentralized application.

3) London Football Exchange will accept the Penta token (PNT) during its contribution process.

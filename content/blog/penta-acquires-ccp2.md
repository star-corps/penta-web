Dear Penta community members:

Penta Global is pleased to announce the successful closing on a purchase of shares from the Australian Security Exchange (ASX) listed company, CCP Technologies (CT1) <!--more-->. 

Using the PNT token, Penta purchased over 28 million shares of CCP at AUD $0.02 per share on July 17, 2018, making Penta Global one of CCP Technology's largest shareholders. The deal was approved by ASX regulators, becoming the first instance where a token cryptocurrency was approved to purchase shares of a publicly listed company on a major stock exchange. As of August 8, 2018 the parties have completed the exchange of PNT tokens for shares, with Penta releasing over 87million PNT tokens. CCP will hold PNT tokens and make regular releases of tokens over a 12 month period. Penta Global looks forward to working with CCP Technologies to developing innovative technology solutions that integrate IOT and blockchain.

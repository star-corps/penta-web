Penta (PNT) official announcement to the community
The Penta Global Foundation believes that recent market pressures have driven the price of PNT far below its true value. In response, the Penta Global Foundation has decided to initiate a buyback program on secondary markets.<!--more-->The total buyback will be 10% of the current circulating supply, amounting to 1.8 billion PNT. As of July 16, 2018, Penta officially started the first stage of the buyback process with a total amount of 200 million PNT. The first stage of the buyback will be completed before 18:00 (Singapore Time) on July 23, 2018. All PNT tokens acquired through the buyback program will be locked for three years. The PNT lock-up address connected with the buyback program is: 8db12de96ba5e452905a01f2fab1bfc85d22cb5f

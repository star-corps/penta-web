Dear Penta community members:

On July 16, 2018, The Penta Global Foundation initiated the first stage of a buyback program on secondary markets, amounting to a total buyback of 200 million PNT. As of 10:46am (Singapore Time) on July 23, 2018, Penta has fully completed the Stage 1 buyback.<!--more-->

Penta plans to buyback a total of 1.8 billion PNT, representing 10% of the current circulating supply. All PNT tokens acquired through the buyback program will be locked for three years. The PNT lock-up address connected with the buyback program is: 8db12de96ba5e452905a01f2fab1bfc85d22cb5f

The Penta Team will provide frequent updates to our community on the progress of the buyback program. Thank you to all our community members for your continued support.

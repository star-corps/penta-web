      <description>&lt;p&gt;Overview&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary goals of the Penta public blockchain are: decentralization, fairness and trust. In order to meet these, besides Penta, any public blockchain project needs to have a clear governance structure to avoid destructive actions or misaligned intentions by the core developers, or the block producers.   Penta aims for a governance process that is both transparent and robust to corruption.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In response, the Penta Global Foundation has decided to initiate a buyback program on secondary markets. The total buyback will be 10% of the current circulating supply, amounting to 1.8 billion PNT. As of July 16, 2018, Penta officially started the first stage of the buyback process with a total amount of 200 million PNT.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hugo uses the excellent &lt;a href=&#34;http://golang.org/&amp;gt;&#34;&gt;go&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://golang.org/pkg/html/template/&amp;gt;&#34;&gt;html/template&lt;/a&gt; library for
its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very
small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of
logic to be able to create a good static website.   If you have used other
template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of
similarities in go templates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content.   I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

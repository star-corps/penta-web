      <description>Overview
The primary goals of the Penta public blockchain are: decentralization, fairness and trust. In order to meet these, besides Penta, any public blockchain project needs to have a clear governance structure to avoid destructive actions or misaligned intentions by the core developers, or the block producers. Penta aims for a governance process that is both transparent and robust to corruption.
At the center of Pentaâ€™s mission to increase economic inclusion and the stability of its blockchain, is a lowering of barriers to entry and increased opportunities for stakeholders to participate in the ecosystem.</description>
